## About

The Health Management Information System (HMIS) revolutionizes patient data collection and storage in healthcare institutions. Our solution replaces the traditional manual process of recording patient details on preprinted paper forms. Staff members can now easily scan these forms using our web app, store the data in a secure database, and generate a printable table with patient information for easy reference.
